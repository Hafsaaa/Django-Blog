# Django-Blog

An interesting web project delivering an exhaustive and complete Blog website using Django for the backend, and Bootstrap for the UI frontend. 

Serves as great base for developing any website with blog-like features. More features will be progressively added to showcase its capabilities.


# Prerequisites

Requires a Django installation and its associated dependencies. If you do not have them, simply run : 
pip install Django

Runs through the latest Python (3.9.0) and Django (3.1.2) versions, but confirmed to be backwards compatible with older versions down to Django 1.8.0.


# Launch Instruactions

Simply fork and clone the project to your local repository, and start the server using the following command in the project main path:
python manage.py runserver

The server will start and will be available at: http://127.0.0.1:8000
